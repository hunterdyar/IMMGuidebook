# The Guidebook
This is the source for '[The Guidebook](http://guidebook.hdyar.com)', a project by [Hunter Dyar](http://hdyar.com).

## Educators
If you are interested in linking to or including the guidebook for your students, go for it! It's free and there for you to use. 
Attribution is not neccesary, but if this guidebook is useful, I would love to hear from you. Reach out here, or via email (hunter [at] dyar [dot] email).

> *Reaching out is great, because I get to include these things on my faculty reports!*

## Contributing
### Issues
For feature requests, or bug/error reports, issues are the best and easiest way to contribute.
You can create one throught his github repo: [Issues](https://github.com/hunterdyar/IMMGuidebook/issues). Include a description, link, to relevant pages, and content.

### Pull Requests
For more complex contributions, or if you are a Student Worker (hello!), it is recommended to contribute via a Pull Request.

Create a Fork of the repo, make your changes, test them locally using Hugo to see that they work, then create a pull request via GitHub. 
Detailed instructions elsewhere for student workers.
